![light painting](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/Roel-Share/light-painting.jpg)

First try at light painting late at night. Had to improvise as I missed the sunset. This meant that there was very little light left in the sky and none on this rock like artwork. Luckely I had a small flashlight in my camera bag and could make do.
